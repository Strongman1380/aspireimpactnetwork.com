2. Click **Products** → **Add product**
3. Name: **DV Program Intake Assessment Fee**
4. Price: **$35.00** (one-time)
5. Click **Create payment link**
6. Set success URL: `https://aspireimpactnetwork.com/success.html?type=dv-intake-payment`
7. Set cancel URL: `https://aspireimpactnetwork.com/dv-classes-enrollment.html`
8. **Copy the payment link** (e.g., `https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxx`)

#### B. Weekly Fee Link ($30.96)
1. Click **Products** → **Add product**
2. Name: **DV Program Weekly Class Fee**

### Step 2: Update Payment Links in Code

```javascript
// Find this section:
const DV_PAYMENT_LINKS = {
    intake: 'https://buy.stripe.com/YOUR_INTAKE_FEE_LINK',
    weekly: 'https://buy.stripe.com/YOUR_WEEKLY_FEE_LINK'
};

// Replace with:
const DV_PAYMENT_LINKS = {
    intake: 'https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxx', // Paste your intake link
    weekly: 'https://buy.stripe.com/yyyyy'  // Paste your weekly link
};
```

**File:** [dv-weekly-payment.html](dv-weekly-payment.html)
**Line:** ~177

```javascript
// Find this:
const WEEKLY_PAYMENT_LINK = 'https://buy.stripe.com/YOUR_WEEKLY_FEE_LINK';

// Replace with:
const WEEKLY_PAYMENT_LINK = 'https://buy.stripe.com/yyyyy'; // Same weekly link
```

### Step 3: Update Database Schema

## 💡 Additional Features You Can Add

### 1. Automatic Payment Receipts (via Stripe)
Stripe automatically sends email receipts. No extra setup needed!

### 2. Payment Reminders (Manual for now)
You can view who's behind on payments in your Supabase database:

```sql
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    weeks_paid,
    36 - weeks_paid as weeks_remaining
FROM dv_enrollments
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY weeks_paid ASC;
```

### 3. Automatic Weekly Billing (Optional)

Instead of manual weekly payments, set up Stripe subscriptions:

**Create in Stripe:**
- Product: "DV Weekly Subscription"
- Price: $30.00
- Billing: Every 1 week
- Duration: 36 weeks (or until cancelled)

**Add to enrollment form as 4th option:**
```html
<option value="auto-weekly">Set Up Automatic Weekly Payments</option>
```

### 4. Payment History for Students (Future)

Create a student portal where they can:
- View payment history
- See weeks remaining
- Download receipts
- Update payment method
