    premier_yearly: 'https://buy.stripe.com/YOUR_ACTUAL_LINK',
    pro_monthly: 'https://buy.stripe.com/YOUR_ACTUAL_LINK',
    pro_yearly: 'https://buy.stripe.com/YOUR_ACTUAL_LINK'
};
```

## Step 4: Test It!

1. Open your website
2. Go to the membership page
3. Click any "Subscribe" button
4. You should be redirected to Stripe's payment page
5. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242` (any future date, any CVV)
6. Complete the test payment
7. You should be redirected to your success page

## Step 5: Go Live!

Once testing is complete:
1. Make sure you're using your **live** keys (already configured)
2. Payment Links work in both test and live mode
3. Deploy your website
4. Start accepting payments!

## How It Works

When a user clicks "Subscribe":
1. The button click triggers the JavaScript function
2. It checks which billing period is selected (monthly/yearly)
3. It redirects the user to the appropriate Stripe Payment Link
4. Stripe handles the entire payment process
5. After payment, user is redirected to your success page
6. Stripe automatically manages subscriptions, invoices, and emails

## Benefits of Payment Links

✅ **No backend code required**
✅ **Stripe handles all payment processing**
✅ **Automatic subscription management**
✅ **Customer portal for managing subscriptions**
✅ **Automatic emails for receipts and invoices**
✅ **Works immediately - no additional setup**

## Managing Subscriptions

Your customers can manage their subscriptions at:
`https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/xxxxxx`

You can find this link in your Stripe Dashboard under Settings → Customer portal

## Need More Control?

If you need more customization, you can switch to Checkout Sessions by:
1. Setting `USE_PAYMENT_LINKS = false` in `stripe-checkout.js`
2. Following the instructions in `STRIPE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
3. Setting up the backend API

But for most use cases, Payment Links are perfect!
