## 📝 Update Your Code

After creating the Stripe payment links, update the [dv-classes-enrollment.html](dv-classes-enrollment.html) file:

**Find this section (around line 422):**

```javascript
// Stripe Payment Links
const DV_PAYMENT_LINKS = {
    intake: 'https://buy.stripe.com/YOUR_INTAKE_FEE_LINK', // You'll need to create this
    weekly: 'https://buy.stripe.com/YOUR_WEEKLY_FEE_LINK'  // You'll need to create this
};
```

**Replace with your actual links:**

```javascript
// Stripe Payment Links
const DV_PAYMENT_LINKS = {
    intake: 'https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxx', // Paste your intake fee link here
    weekly: 'https://buy.stripe.com/yyyyy'  // Paste your weekly fee link here
};
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### For New Enrollments (Intake Fee)

1. **User fills out enrollment form**
2. **User selects "Pay Intake Fee Now ($35)"**
3. **Click "Proceed to Payment"** button appears
4. **Form validates** all required fields
5. **Enrollment saves to Supabase** database
6. **User redirects to Stripe** for secure payment
7. **After payment**, redirects to success page

### For Weekly Payments (Current Students)

1. **User goes to enrollment page**
2. **User selects "Make a Weekly Payment"**
3. **Clicks "Proceed to Weekly Payment"** button
4. **Redirects to Stripe** for $30.96 payment
5. **After payment**, redirects to success page

### For Payment Later

1. **User fills out form**
2. **Selects "Pay Intake Fee Later"**
3. **Submits enrollment** normally
4. **No payment redirect** - they can call/pay in person

```
