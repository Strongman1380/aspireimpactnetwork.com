# Visibility & Display Issues - FIXED ✅

## Problems Identified and Resolved

### 1. ✅ Missing Color Variables (MAJOR ISSUE)
**Problem:** CSS was referencing old color variables that no longer existed after the green theme update, causing text and backgrounds to be invisible.

**Old undefined variables:**
- `--warm-cream`
- `--light-gray`
- `--text-dark`
- `--neutral-gray`
- `--tech-blue`
- `--primary-cyan`
- `--neon-purple`
- `--accent-purple`

**Fixed by replacing with:**
- `--card-bg` (for backgrounds)
- `--text-bright` (for bright text)
- `--text-light` (for regular text)
- `--primary-green` (main brand color)
- `--dark-green` (accents)
- `--electric-teal` (secondary accents)

**Files affected:** `css/styles.css` (50+ replacements)

---

### 2. ✅ Duplicate CSS Definitions
**Problem:** `.hero-container` was defined twice with conflicting properties (grid vs flexbox), causing layout breaks.

**Fixed:**
- Removed duplicate definition at line ~3585
- Kept unified flexbox-based layout
- Globe and content now display side-by-side properly

---

### 3. ✅ Missing CSS Classes
**Problem:** Images referenced classes that didn't exist (`.tech-image-glow`, `.overview-image`)

**Fixed:**
- Added `.tech-image-glow` with green drop-shadow effects
- Added `.overview-image` container styling
- Added `.image-placeholder` fallback styling
- Added hover effects for interactive feel

---

### 4. ✅ Page Header Visibility
**Problem:** Page headers had light backgrounds with dark text on pages other than homepage

**Fixed:**
- Updated `.page-header` background to dark gradient
- Changed text colors to light/bright green
- Added subtle green glow to headings
- Improved contrast ratio

---

### 5. ✅ Impact Banner Colors
**Problem:** Impact banner using undefined color variables

**Fixed:**
- Updated gradient to use green theme colors
- Updated radial gradient overlays to green tones
- Added border glow effects
- Maintained animation

---

### 6. ✅ Text Contrast Issues
**Problem:** Some text had poor contrast against dark backgrounds

**Fixed:**
- All body text now uses `--text-light` (#e0ffe0) - light green tint
- Headings use `--text-bright` (#ccffcc) - brighter green
- Added subtle text shadows where appropriate
- Improved opacity values for better readability
